Pro Mode for YouTube Video Editor Chrome Extension

## Introduction
Pro Mode for YouTube Video Editor is a Chrome extension which enhances the YouTube Video Editor with keyboard shortcuts and other usability improvements. It was born of many frustrations associating with editing lengthy videos using the video editor. I plan to continue improving this as needed and pull requests are welcome :)

## Installation
This extension should be installed using the Chrome store. Alternatively, the extension can be loaded directly into Chrome by cloning the project locally, going to chrome://extensions/, clicking 'Load unpacked extension...' and selecting the cloned project folder. Make sure that the Developer mode option is checked.

## Usage
The extension activates when you browse to the YouTube video editor url (https://www.youtube.com/editor). All of the keyboard shortcuts are documented on the help screen which can be opened by pressing the 'H' key.

### Start / Stop playback

The spacebar will start and stop playback of the current clip or the entire video. This is useful as the editor will often immediately start playing back after *every* edit.

### Tab selection keys

Keys 1-6 are used for selecting the various editing tabs (Video, Audio, Photos, etc). Pressing them will allow you to select another piece of content without losing the current selection. This is useful because when the current clip is unselected, the player preview will start from the beginning, causing you to lose your place in the video.

### Timeline navigation

The 'P' key will scroll the timeline to the currently selected clip. This is convenient because often the timeline will automatically scroll to the start despite having a clip selected. The '[' and ']' keys allow scrolling to the start and end of the timeline.

### Sort photos

When the Photos tab is open, the 'S' key will cause the current set of photos to be sorted alphabetically. This is useful when re-opening an existing project with photos causes them to be displayed out of order.
